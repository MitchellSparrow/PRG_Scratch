## Storyline


The year is 2563 and the 287th annual rocket championships has arrived.

All inhabitants in the galaxy are very excited to see who the winning planet will be this year!

The winning planet is awarded a prize of 300 quadrillion pounds, if their nominated competitor passes more asteroids in the asteroid belt than the rest of the competitors.

No prize money is awarded for any planet's competitor who crashes their rocket.

You have been selected randomly as planet Earth's 287th competitor for this year.

Try and pass as many asteroids as possible in your rocket without crashing!

You have a chance to win 300 quadrillion pounds for your planet!

## Description


Join us in playing Scratch, Scratchâ€™s first and only AAA title release.

The members of Scratch have come together to create the must have arcade game this holiday season.

Inspired by the game flappy bird and characteristically developed from scratch, our game uses no APIs to take the the user on a journey through space.

The aim of the game is to avoid the incoming asteroids in your Rocket as you gain score.

Beware however, as you progress the game becomes more difficult! Asteroids begin to move faster incrementally every 5 score achieved, so your reactions will be tested! 

We hope you have fun trying to beat the high score!

The game has been tested on Windows and Mac OS. Debugging has also been performed thoroughly.

Flappy Rocket can be played in windowed or full screen mode, by using the full screen option in the settings menu.

The home screen can be brought up at any time during the game by pressing escape, where you are greeted by tutorial, settings and quit options.

In the tutorial you can familiarise yourself with the movement controls of your rocket (using the arrow keys) and learn the asteroids behaviour without worrying about a collision (or loss). 

The settings menu allows you to toggle the music and full screen mode options on/off to suit your preferences.

If you want to hop straight into the game simply press the spacebar on the home screen, make sure to avoid those dangerous asteroids!

Enjoy!
