## Description


Join us in playing Scratch, Scratchâ€™s first and only AAA title release

The members of Scratch have come together to create the must have arcade game this holiday season

Inspired by the game flappy bird and characteristically developed from scratch our game uses no APIs to take the the user on a journey through space

The aim of the game is to avoid the incoming asteroids with your spaceship as you gain score

Beware however, as you progress the game becomes more difficult! Asteroids begin to move faster incrementally for every 5 score achieved as your reactions are tested 

We hope you have fun trying to beat your high scores!

The game runs has been tested on Windows and Mac OS and tested for bugs

Flappy Spaceship be played in windowed or full screen mode by using the full screen button in the menus

The menu can be brought up at any time during the game by pressing escape where you are greeted by a tutorial, settings and quit options upon opening the game 

In the tutorial you can learn the movement controls for your rocket (using the arrow keys) and learn the asteroids behaviour without worrying about losing 

The settings allows you to toggle music or full screen mode 

If you want to hop straight into the game simply press spacebar

Enjoy!
